Bamboo toxicity prediction using k-means clustering

Machine learning methods to predict Bamboo cyanogen toxicity is of great importance. Various methods were tested by generating data using bamboo shoots collected from fields of dakshina kannada district, Karnataka. The various pre-processing methods have been tested like soaking in plain water, soaking in salt water of varying salt concentration, boiling and enzymatic degradation. The code describes the machine learning approach.

The bamboo shoot utility
Bamboo shoots were utilized by several ethnic tribes in Northeast India to reduce high blood pressure and cardiovascular problems. It has been extensively used by local tribes such as the Bodo, Thadau, Mosang, and Tiwa who employ bamboo shoots for treating various ailments.
Fresh shoots have a crisp, crunchy texture and a sweet flavour that gives them a distinct flavour. Shoots can also be used as a flavour enhancer since the tissue absorbs the flavour. 

Bamboo Toxicity

Despite the benefits of Bamboo, it is not accepted readily by the population. The important components which cause toxicity to human are taxiphyllin or cyanogenic glycosides. Removal of the cyanogen is very important before consumption. The study addresses the methods to extract the cyanogen in the bamboo shoot. The method used in this study are Picrate paper method – with variations like 1%, 5%, 10% NaCl, and boiling water.
Processing and storage of bamboo shoot:
Bamboo shoots were collected from different places and were stored at -80℃  as a pre-processing step.
The bamboo shoot was divided into three parts tip, middle, and bottom. Each part of the sample was treated with variations – 1% NaCl, 5% NaCl, 10% NaCl and boiling. The cyanide was subjected to 3, 12, 16 hours of incubation for different parts of shoot. Cyanide was calculated in parts per million (ppm).

Unsupervised Clustering by K-means in Machine Learning

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms were applied to process the learning data. The K-means algorithm in data mining starts randomly selected centroids, every cluster, and then performs iterative calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids. Scikit-learn library was used to process data. K-means clustering for classification has been applied successfully using scikit module in Python.
