bamboo toxicity prediction using k-means clustering

Machine learning methods to predict Bamboo cyanogen toxicity is of great importance.
Various methods were tested by generating data using bamboo shoots collected from fields of dakshina kannada district, Karnataka.
The various pre-processing methods have been tested example soaking in plain water, soaking in salt water of varying salt concentration, boiling and enzymatic degradation.
The code describes the machine learning approach.
